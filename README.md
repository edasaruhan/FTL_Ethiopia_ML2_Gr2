## Project Proposal: AirSense - AI-Powered Air Quality Monitoring & Forecasting

### 1. Project Idea:
AirSense aims to develop a system that analyzes historical and real-time air quality data to forecast pollution levels (e.g., PM2.5, NO₂) and deliver actionable health alerts for urban residents. The goal is to empower city officials and the public to make informed decisions that reduce exposure to harmful pollutants.

### 2. Relevance to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):
This project aligns with SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) by addressing air pollution, a major environmental health risk. It also supports SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) by promoting sustainable urban development through informed decision-making.

### 3. Literature Examples:
1. **Air Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms**: This study explores the use of machine learning models to predict air quality indices, demonstrating the feasibility of data-driven forecasting.
2. **DeepAir: A Deep Learning Framework for Air Quality Forecasting**: This research highlights the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in modeling complex air quality patterns.

### 4. Describe Your Data:
We will use the **Beijing Multi-Site Air-Quality Data Set** from Kaggle. The dataset includes historical air quality measurements (e.g., PM2.5, NO₂) in CSV format. Preprocessing steps will include handling missing values, feature scaling, and time-series transformation.

### 5. Approach (Machine Learning or Deep Learning):
We will begin with a machine learning approach using models like Random Forest and XGBoost due to their efficiency and interpretability for structured time-series data. If needed, deep learning models like LSTM will be explored in the later stages to improve prediction accuracy.
